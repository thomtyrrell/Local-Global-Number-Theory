# Local-Global-Number-Theory
Code for studying the Brauer-Manin obstruction, Hasse principle, and other local/global problems in arithmetic geometry and number theory.  All files with a .sage or .sws extension are written in Python.

## Bremner.sage
This code implements a construction due to A. Bremner in "Some Interesting Curves of genus 2 to 7", Journal of Number Theory, 67, 277-290 (1997)

## MordellWeilSieve.sage
This code can be used to study the Brauer-Manin Obstruction.

## Modular Forms and Twists of Rank 0.sws
This sage worksheet breaks down one example in the theory of 3/2-weight modular forms and their relationship to ranks of elliptic curves.  For more information, see <a href=http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~ono/publications-cv/pdfs/014.pdf>"Rank zero quadratic twists of modular elliptic curves" by Ken Ono</a>.  

###Planned Additions
- Sage worksheet (.sws) illustrating the use of MordellWeilSieve.sage
- References to related papers
